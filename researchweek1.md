My name is Raya. I am a free spirirted earthling. I enjoy uplifitng myself and others! 
My initial assumption of the course technical writing was that it was going to be a tough course for me. Technical writing sounds like a left brained skill/activity. I didn’t believe it was going to directly correlate with my emotionally abstract right brain domination. My specialty in writing usually involves creatively inclined ventures, but after reading the readings, I realized this course is something that I will really enjoy. I actually like ventures that challenge my “norms”, It feels expansive to me! I understand the importance of breaking complex things down into simple, easy to read pieces/writings.
It was a very new experience setting up a repository on github. Although, once I learned the features, it wasn’t as complex as I originally thought it to be. The HelloWorld tutorial showed me key features to maneuvering around github. It seems like a bit more coverage than what was presented in class, likely because we are just starting. I also may have missed the in depth coverage from you, Jason.
I believe the audience for PierceHacker is the whole community of Pierce college, whether it be professors, students or staff who are interested in developing technical skills and critical information competency. The delivery of this website via the medium of a public website was likely because of the technological basis our school system depends on. This website helps the pierce community better understand the way technology shapes the work we engage in inside and outside of the classroom. The main audience for programming historian are humanists interested in technical skills. The purpose seems to be humanitarianly based, and wishes to teach a wide range of digital tools and techniques. This was delivered via the medium of a public website because it wishes to foster a diverse and inclusive community, all which can be reached via the means of a public website.
Finally, as best you can, try to articulate what you feel you’ve learned this week?
In the short amount I’ve been present in class this week, I feel as if I’ve learned a lot about the world of technical writing. I realized the importance of reader-centric rhetoric, and taking care to focus on writing in persuasive ways that readers will respond to.
